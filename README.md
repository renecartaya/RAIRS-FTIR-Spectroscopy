# RAIRS/FTIR-Spectroscopy

Repository dedicated to the reading, cleaning, processing and visualization of Infrared Spectrums data obtaind by Reflective Absorbative Infrarred Spectroscopy (RAIRS/FTIR) over thin film samples in the context of nanofabrication processes research. For this purpose, two analogues scripts has been developed in R and Python. The codes are aimed to read csv files in .txt and .DPT formats.
